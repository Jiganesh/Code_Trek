Key takeaways and learnings from my mistake:
- Remember you just need to solve one question a day that's it that's the secret.Nothing more Nothing less. This statergy avoids depression, burnout and maintains consistency and helps to get whatever you studied absorbed. 

- Rather than solving three questions try to solve one question with three approaches (this thing exponentially improved problem solving skills)

- Read others code a lot. 

- If a  beginner better to go with Java (I choose python - realized not good in long run switching to Java)

- Better to go through GFG and Codeforces once in a while. 

- Focus a lot on development for long run (70-80 % development and 30-20 % DSA) is good combination ) (one of the things I didnt realize)

- stay consistent (no longer break than a week its fine to take a day off I think you must take a day off in month to avoid burnout)

- Dont forget to do system design, 20-30 % of the time Bar Raisers are system design rounds

- Every thing takes time DSA certainly does hang on to it for 1 or 2 years

- Quality >>>> Quantity 

- Focus on Medium Leetcode Questions
