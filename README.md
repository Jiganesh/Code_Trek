- With help of above resources **cleared InfyTQ Round 1**


`key takeaways - Go through solutions of other people you will definitely learn a lot of new approaches`

### Fourth Year Second Semester ARC
Did Some Java and Javascript
Didn't do much programming after that just random stuff enjoyed as I already had offer (shouldnt have done that)

POST Graduation ARC

- Joined Infosys in September 2022
- Done with Training ( Just after 3-4 weeks I got allocated to good project early so no further training or bench for me)
- I also gave applied from Amazon job portal but was not able to understand question - `31st October 2021`
- I was allocated Big Data Stream which I chose during my Training (Really Loved the Project I was allocated)
- I also gave an Interview for Accenture 4.5 LPA Role (Randomly applied because I was bored)
  - Average Interview - Project based Questions, HR Questions (Got Offer for 6.5 LPA role)
  - Didnt Accept Offer of 6.5 LPA with Accenture because Infosys was paying 6.25 LPA later

### Key takeaways and learnings from my mistake
- Remember you just need to solve one question a day that's it that's the secret.
- Nothing more Nothing less. This statergy avoids depression, burnout and maintains consistency and helps to get whatever you studied absorbed. 
- I loved programming so I used to hit 16 hours daily doing it - office work included
- Rather than solving three questions try to solve one question with three approaches (this thing exponentially improved problem solving skills)
- Read others code a lot. 
- If a  beginner better to go with Java (I choose python - realized not good in long run switching to Java)
- Better to go through GFG and Codeforces once in a while. 
- Focus a lot on development for long run (70-80 % development and 30-20 % DSA) is good combination ) (one of the things I didnt realize)
- Stay consistent (no longer break than a week its fine to take a day off I think you must take a day off in month to avoid burnout)
- Dont forget to do system design, 20-30 % of the time Bar Raisers are system design rounds
- Every thing takes time DSA certainly does hang on to it for 1 or 2 years
- Quality >>>> Quantity 
- Focus on Medium Leetcode Questions

### How to make good Projects 

The Project is said to be good when you 
- or others can use it in their day to day life.
- can show it solves any real life problem no matter how big or small it is 
- can explain its complexity and make interviewer interested in project
- build it end to end from architecture/design to deployment and can explain in depth about it
- have fun building it and get lots of learnings 
- work with Teams or other people showing soft skills

### ONE QUESTION A DAY KEEPS UNEMPLOYMENT AWAY
